From 538:

> The Major League Baseball playoffs are about to begin. Based on the current playoff format, what is the best possible winning percentage a team can have in the playoffs without winning the World Series? And what is the worst possible winning percentage a team can have in the playoffs and still win the World Series?

### Solution

-   **Best Possible Winning Percentage without winning World Series:** 73.3% (11-4 record). This requires the team to win the wild card game, go 3-0 in the Division Series, 4-0 in the League championship series, and 3-4 in the World Series.
-   **Worst Possible Winning Percentage with winning World Series:** 57.9% (11-8 record). This requires the team to skip the wild card game, go 3-2 in the Division Series, 4-3 in the League championship series, and 4-3 in the World Series.

> You’ve just been hired to work in a juicy middle-management role at Riddler HQ — welcome aboard! We relocated you to a tastefully appointed apartment in Riddler City, five blocks west and 10 blocks south of the office. (The streets of Riddler City, of course, are laid out in a perfect grid.) You walk to work each morning and back home each evening. Restless and inquisitive mathematician that you are, you prefer to walk a different path along the streets each time. How long can you stay in that apartment before you are forced to walk the same path twice? (Assume you don’t take paths that are longer than required, and assume beaucoup bonus points for not using your computer.)
